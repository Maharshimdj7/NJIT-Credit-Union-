# NJIT-Credit-Union-
Java Servlet Program that represents a pseudo ATM machine where user will authenticate their userID from the client side and after successful authentication make a deposit, withdraw funds and get current balance information. 

Here the program is inspired by the Zelle system of sending money to other accounts. If the transfer is made then it should reflect ino other account.

Used JSP to build the web-page and css for stylings, servlet for the calls and other procedures and the database is maintained by MySQL.
